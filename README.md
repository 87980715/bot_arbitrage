# Repo for a arbitrage Bot
Current version is totally WIP (even this README is WIP)
Status: Working MVP with proper arbitrage detection but ineficient data collection and poor arbitrage handling (just a sout)

// Ryan: update README - include a nice explanation as well as a "How-To" and/or
 "Getting Started" section - the more detail and clarity you can provide on what
 this project does, the technologies it uses, and how to get started using it the
 better
